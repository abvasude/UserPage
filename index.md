## Personal Life
### Personal Background
I was born in the Bay Area in California. I am an Indian and I have an older sister who graduated from UC Irvine with a degree in Computer Science.

### Sports and Outdoor Activities
I am a huge cricket fan and I love playing cricket in my spare time. In my free time, I love to bowl to a wicket in my garage to practice my form. In addition, I enjoy going on runs to relieve stress. Over summer breaks, I love hiking and going on drives with my parents and my older sister. My favorite travel spots are 

1. Yellow Stone National Park
2. [Lake Tahoe](Images/IMG_0146.jpg)
3. Bryce National Park
4. Yosemite
5. Jasper, Alberta
6. Zion National Park

### Music

I also play a couple of instruments. One of the instruments that I play is the clarinet which I have been playing for 10 years. In fact, I even performed at Carnegie Hall along with my high school band in New York. Secondly, I play the tabla which is an Indian Classical Percussion Instrument which I have been learning for 7 years.

### Games
In my free time, I love to play video games such as *Super Smash Bros*, *Halo*, *Super Mario Galaxy*, and *Valorant*.

### Favorite Quote
One of my favorite quotes of all time is by Mike Hawkins
> You don't get results by focusing on results. You get results by focusing on the actions that produce results.

This is a motto to live by because if you focus too much on the end result such as a grade, you will not focus on the action itself which will disorient an individual from what that person needs to do.


## Education
### Lower Studies
I attended elementary, middle, and high school in San Ramon, California where I spent most of my childhood. In addition, I also completed courses online at Brigham Young University and Contra Costa Community College to enhance my understanding of Computer Science and Engineering.

### University
*I am currently a sophomore student at the University of California San Diego where I study Computer Engineering.* 

This is a tasklist of all of the **core** major courses that an individual studying Computer Engineer must complete and how many classes I have completed. More information is provided on the [Computer Engineering Major Requirements Page](https://ece.ucsd.edu/undergraduate/undergraduate-programs/computer-engineering-major).

## Experience in Technology
From a young age, I always had an interest in Math and Computer Science. When I was 12, I started learning Java and soon after, I started coding in Python and C#. In high school, I joined many clubs such as the Computer Science club and Mu Alpha Theta Math club. In my Junior year of high school, I was invited to Lawrence Livermore Labs as a IT job shadow where I learned about advanced technology that scientists and engineers use to solve real world problems.

In my first year of college, I learned more about Object Oriented Programming in Java, C, C++, and I also learned how to use vim, bash, and terminal commands. Learning how to use a terminal became extremely useful when coding in java, python, and even organizing my computer's contents. Important commands that I learned are `ls`, `cd`, `diff`, `cat`, `grep`, and `rm` to name a few.

In the summer after my first year of college, I joined my first internship where I learned Machine Learning and its applications in data science and statistics.
